Key Files and Their Purpose:
---------------------------
1. atm_gui.py
   - The main GUI application for the ATM Machine using tkinter.
   - Handles user/admin login, account creation, transactions, and user management.
   - Connects to the SQLite database (atm.db) to load and update user data.

2. Atm.py
   - Contains the ATM and Admin classes.
   - Defines user/admin authentication, account operations (deposit, withdraw, etc.), and admin functions.

3. atm_utils.py
   - Utility functions and constants (e.g., ADMIN_ACCOUNT, ADMIN_PIN, OTP generation, user management helpers).
   - May include database helper functions like create_user, get_user, etc.

4. Atm_Admin.py
   - Kept for backward compatibility.
   - Refers to Admin class (now in Atm.py) and utility imports.

5. atm.db
   - SQLite database file storing all user, admin, and transaction data.
   - Tables: users, transactions, admin, etc.

6. atm-machine-api/
   - Contains FastAPI-based REST API code (not used by the tkinter GUI).
   - For web/API access to ATM data (optional, not required for GUI operation).

How the ATM Machine Works (Step by Step):
-----------------------------------------
1. **Start the Application**
   - Run `atm_gui.py` to launch the ATM Machine GUI.

2. **Main Menu**
   - Options: Login as Admin, Login to Existing Account, Create New Account, View Total Users, View User List, Exit.

3. **Admin Login**
   - Enter admin account and PIN (from atm_utils.py constants).
   - Access admin panel: view all users, delete/reset users, view total funds, edit user details, etc.

4. **User Login**
   - Enter account number and PIN.
   - Two-factor authentication with OTP.
   - Access user menu: check balance, withdraw/deposit, view history, change PIN, update details, logout.

5. **Create New Account**
   - Enter account details (number, PIN, balance, name, address, blood group).
   - Account is created in memory and stored in atm.db.

6. **Database Usage**
   - All user data is loaded from and saved to `atm.db` using sqlite3.
   - User details, balances, and transactions are persistent.

7. **Utilities**
   - OTP generation, admin constants, and user management helpers are in atm_utils.py.

8. **API (Optional)**
   - The atm-machine-api/ folder contains FastAPI code for REST API access (not required for GUI).

How to Check/Access the Database:
---------------------------------
- Use DB Browser for SQLite (https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) to open and inspect `atm.db`.
- Or use Python's sqlite3 module to run queries and view data.

How to Run the ATM Machine:
---------------------------
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the following command in PowerShell:
   ```
   python ATM_Machine/atm_gui.py
   ```
3. The GUI will open and you can use all ATM features.

How to see Database: 
--------------------
1. ctrl + shift + P 
2. it will open atm.db file and show your Database
